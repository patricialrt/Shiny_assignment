Assignment No 4 for Coursera: Developing Data Products

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.
Your Shiny Application:
- Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever 
a user will need to get started using your application.
- Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
- Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
- Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

The application must include the following:
- Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
- Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
- Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
- You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
- The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
